Explanation
Sender Script:

Reads and sends the file in chunks of 1024 bytes.
Continues sending chunks until the entire file is sent.
Prints the number of bytes sent in each chunk.
Receiver Script:

Receives data in chunks of 1024 bytes.
Writes each chunk to the file until all data is received.
Prints the number of bytes received in each chunk.
This should ensure that even larger files are transferred correctly and that the scripts handle the data transmission more robustly.
